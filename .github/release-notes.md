# brahman-buddy 20261108.13

A personal work buddy: Telegram, Lark and Feishu chats driving Claude Code, with scheduled
jobs, short stories (one card per piece of pipeline-bound work) and long stories (an agent
session followed from the phone).

## Install

| You have | Take | Then |
|---|---|---|
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | PyPI | `uv tool install brahman-buddy`, later `uv tool upgrade brahman-buddy` (or the wheel here: `uv tool install ./brahman_buddy-20261108.13-py3-none-any.whl`); in the first minutes after a release add `--refresh`, since uv keeps PyPI's list of versions for a while |
| nothing, Linux | `buddy-linux-x86_64` (x86-64) or `buddy-linux-arm64` (ARM64) | `chmod +x` it, then run it |
| nothing, Windows | `buddy-windows-x64.exe` (x64) or `buddy-windows-arm64.exe` (ARM64) | run it from a terminal |
| nothing, macOS | `buddy-macos-arm64` (Apple silicon) or `buddy-macos-x86_64` (Intel) | `chmod +x` it; the first run may need System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway (it is not notarized) |
| a closed or strict network | `brahman-workbench-20261108.13-<platform>` (.tar.gz, or .zip on Windows): the buddy and pys, everything inside | unpack, then `./install.sh` (or `install.ps1`); nothing is downloaded |

Every way needs Claude Code too, installed and logged in. Then: `buddy init`, `buddy service
install --enable`, write to your bot, `buddy allow <the id it tells you>`, `buddy doctor`.

## What is new

- **`buddy setup` reruns cleanly on Windows.** On 20261108.10 a second run wanted to relink
  skills whose links were already right: Windows spells a link's target its own way, so the
  link's text never matched the folder it leads to. Links are now compared as the real folders
  they lead to. Found by the release's test on a real Windows 11 ARM64.
- Where Windows allows no symlinks at all (Developer Mode off), setup copies the skills, and a
  rerun keeps that copy as up to date instead of copying again.
- The release's CI now runs `buddy setup` end to end on every platform, and for real with pys
  (from PyPI, with its own setup) on Linux, macOS and Windows, a second run included; the
  release waits for both.

## How it was checked

Each executable was built and then used on its own operating system by this release's
workflow (help, init, allow, doctor, a short story, the service, the status), before the
release was published. `SHA256SUMS` lists every file.
